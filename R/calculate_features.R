#' @param df A dataframe which contains protein sequence names as the first column and amino acid sequence as the second column
#' @param min_len Minimum length sequence for which features can be calculated. It is an error to provide sequences with length shorter than this
#'
#' @return A dataframe containing numerical values related to the protein features of each given protein
